# Unemployment Analysis in India

A data science project aimed at analyzing and visualizing the unemployment trends in India using various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Description
This project analyzes unemployment data in India to identify trends, patterns, and insights. The analysis covers different regions, states, and demographic factors to understand the underlying causes of unemployment and its impact on the economy.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unemployment-analysis-india.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd unemployment-analysis-india
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Load and clean the dataset.
    - Handle missing values and outliers.
    - Normalize or scale data if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Run the EDA scripts to generate insights.
    - Visualize trends using plots and charts.

3. **Modeling**:
    - Apply various machine learning models to predict unemployment trends.
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Visualization**:
    - Generate visualizations such as bar plots, box plots, pie charts, and heatmaps to represent the data and findings.

Run the main script to see the complete analysis:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Data
